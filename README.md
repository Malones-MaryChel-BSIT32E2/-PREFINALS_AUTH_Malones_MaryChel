Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered) Conceptual Understanding:
 
Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design? YES
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
YES
 
Web API: (Yes/No)
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 
YES
 
Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
 
-Flexibility -Decoupling -Scalability
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
YES
Differences from MVC:(Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

Traditional MVC applications: Focus on delivering views (HTML pages) to users.
Web APIs: Designed to provide data (typically in JSON or XML format) for client applications to consume.

Bottlenecks (Encountered):(Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s).

Yes
MVC Applications: Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead.
Web APIs: Complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach.
